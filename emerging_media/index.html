    <h2 id="chapter-title">It starts in schools</h2>

    <hr>



    <p>Picture a row of dome-shaped monitors lined up over various desks across the aisles from where you’re sitting in the classroom. One of these monitors also sits in front of you, now, at your desk.
        On the upper half of this massive hunk of plastic casing on the side facing you is a black screen about the size of your head. You can see your reflection in it.
         It’s a cathode ray tube monitor — so the glass screen protrudes out slightly, like a soap bubble freshly escaping its wand. Attached at the base, molded such that it peaks up for easier access to your hands, is a keyboard.</p>

    <p>The year is 1976, you’re in journalism school — and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769587603100402?journalCode=jmca"><strong>survey results</a></strong> have just come out of the University of Maryland’s Communication Research Center. The center heard back from 131 journalism departments at colleges around the country just like your own. They found that 28 percent of surveyed journalism schools were training their students in the use of VDTs, otherwise known as video display terminals, which are individual interfaces (usually in the form of CRT monitors) that allow users to connect to a larger, central mainframe computer. The results also revealed that 50 percent of schools that did not have VDT equipment were planning on obtaining it within the following two years.</p>

    <p>Here, we begin to see indicators of a market change within the world of journalism and its business affairs. Schools (in an ideal view) educate students in skills that are required in the profession or discipline they are studying to become a part of. Schools in this period were beginning to buy into VDT technology as more and more newsrooms began to join in on this new innovation.</p>

    <p>Important to note, however, is that this technology was not necessarily widespread or in great supply among the schools surveyed at this time. Nine of the schools which responded to the survey only had one terminal in supply. Three schools had formal arrangements for use of terminals through off-campus providers. The largest on-campus supply of these terminals came out of the University of Texas, which had 15 terminals in stock.</p>

  <div class="container">


    <p>The survey billed the terminals and their accompanying mainframe systems as “electronic editing equipment,” a replacement for the traditional work of a typewriter. Newsrooms across the nation first began incorporating computer terminals for this kind of typesetting work at the beginning of the 1970s, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/19/archives/computers-are-changing-newsrooms-across-nation.html"><strong>a 1976 article in The New York Times.</a></strong> In that article tucked deep into the back pages of the Late City edition, The Times announced their move towards using computer terminals for writing and editing copy.</p>

    <p>The move away from typewriters and editor’s pencils would enable instant corrections for misspellings and typos, allow editors to reorder, insert and delete paragraphs through commands on their keyboards and give anyone in the newsroom access to arriving dispatches from staff reporters and wire service agencies through circuits plugged into the mainframe computer’s memory.</p>

    <p>All of this, of course, would speed up the writing and editing process. Time would be saved from the messy corrections resulting from errors on a typewriter as well as from transporting physical pieces of paper around the newsroom. VDTs allowed for instant transmissions between desks, streamlining the writing process.</p>

    <p>The Times article says the paper planned to phase in the computer terminals over a period of years, starting first with their features desk and then moving them onto the general news desk.</p>

    <p>All of this, of course, would come at a cost. A buy-in was necessary since any individual computer terminals a newsroom would like to purchase would also require the purchase of a central mainframe computer to go along with them.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter-title">Barriers to entry</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>And it could be quite expensive. There was a definitive cost to entry with VDTs. <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/1298108346"><strong>A 1981 article</a></strong> published in the Columbia Journalism Review cited a report from the American Newspaper Publishers Association which estimated a “fully automated” VDT system, like The Times envisioned, would cost about $200,000 to install 20 terminals into a newsroom. For perspective, that would cost around $600,000 in today’s dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ CPI inflation calculator. A large newsroom like that of The Times would need more than just 20 terminals. A more realistic estimate of such a cost in the ANPA’s report comes from The Washington Post’s $8 million investment into a VDT system, equivalent to around $24 million in today’s dollars. All of this, of course, would be on top of operating costs and salaries.</p>

  <div class="container" class="two-panel">

    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-md-6">

        <p>It’s obvious, then, that VDTs were not available to everyone and would shut out news outlets that could not afford to invest. The Washington Post <a href="https://search.proquest.com/docview/139333024/"><strong>reported in 1988</a></strong> that Black-owned newspapers at the time lacked capital and advertising revenue when compared to their predominantly white-owned counterparts. Even disregarding racial inequities in access, papers with smaller budgets would also be shut out.</p>

        <p>In spite of these barriers to entry, workers in newsrooms that employed the use of computer terminals received the innovation with great enthusiasm, claiming they allow journalists to do better jobs, wrote author and researcher Dominique Wolton in a <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/1298100340?&imgSeq=1"><strong>1979 Columbia Journalism Review article.</a></strong> The workers Wolton spoke to, however, were completely oblivious to the possible future implications of computers entering the newsroom, he writes.</p>

        <p>With every revolutionary innovation comes inevitable critics — and Wolton was one of the earliest, most prescient critics of computers in the newsroom.</p>

        <p>Wolton surmised that as computers began to further encroach into more roles in the newsroom beyond typesetting and editing, they would dramatically alter the role of reporters in the newsroom and the industry’s division of labor, erode the financial stability of print media and — perhaps most eerily — lead to a shift in news coverage becoming less general, more vacuous and highly personalized.</p>

        <p>One example Wolton foresaw was that VDTs would blur the lines between reporters, typesetters and other print production workers, disrupting the newsroom’s workflow.</p>

        <p>“The increasingly technical role journalists play not only upsets the traditional organization of the work process and calls the news product into question; it also alters the division of labor within in the industry," Wolton wrote. Wolton, with an almost Marxian fervor, went on to mention the way this technological disruption would also affect organized labor within newsrooms, as the layoffs of production workers would leave journalists all alone in dealing with management.</p>

    <p>Drawing ire from cultural critics in academic journals notwithstanding, there were other, larger risks that came along with adopting VDTs into the newsroom.</p>

    <p>Technology, after all, is fallible.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter-title">The risks</h2>

  <div class="container">

    <p>On the evening of July 3, 1983, The Washington Post’s newsroom failed to publish 100,000 copies of their first edition Sunday paper after 300 terminals and 12 computer banks died less than three hours before their first edition was scheduled to begin printing, according to a <a href="https://archive.org/details/sim_editor-publisher_1983-07-16_116_29/page/16/mode/2up"><strong>report in Editor & Publisher magazine.</a></strong></p>

    <p>Most of the copy reporters had written during the day had disappeared in an instant. For many lucky writers, they had printout copies of their stories, but some had to re-write their stories from scratch and enter them into The Post’s backup system with 40 terminals.</p>


    <p>After scrambling to reassemble the Sunday paper, The Post was able to run their second edition out to the presses — albeit 15 minutes behind schedule.</p>

    <p>“This was unlike anything else we’ve had in three years of experience with the system,” Don Rice, then The Post’s vice president of operations, told Editor & Publisher.</p>

    <p>The Post couldn’t get their main VDT system up and running until noon the next day, taking technicians half a day to find the faulty disc drive that caused the system outage.</p>

    <p>A large newsroom like The Washington Post had the luxury of a backup computer system, many technicians on call working to fix the outage and failsafes in the form of hard copies of some of their written news stories. It could have been catastrophic otherwise. What took The Post half a day’s work could have taken a much smaller, more inexperienced newsroom weeks to recover from.</p>

    <p>We like to think as technology advances it reduces its risks and flaws over time. The vulnerabilities of technology of the past are no longer with us, we’d like to think.</p>

    <h2 id="chapter-title">The throughline</h2>

    <hr>

    <p>But there’s a striking similarity between video display terminals and modern computing — the cloud. As mentioned earlier, VDTs are merely an interface a user can use only when connected to a central mainframe controller. It’s why they were fondly called “dumb terminals,” as they had no ability to process information on their own. Much like how a laptop or desktop computer has no ability to modify or access a file stored in the cloud unless connected through the internet.</p>

    <p>In what was likely a similar moment of terror to the 1983 outage, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/01/04/slack-outage-work-disruption/"><strong>The Washington Post reported</a></strong> on popular workplace chat application Slack’s January 2021 outage. The app was down for nearly four hours, according to The Post, sending droves of workers to Twitter to comment on the outage.</p>

    <p>Slack allows users to send and store files and communicate with coworkers through instant messaging and calls, all of which were gone during the duration of the outage.</p>

    <p>Companies rely on many similar apps to perform their basic daily functions: Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, and similar outages have likely meant hours of lost work.</p>

    <p>All in all, it tells us that 50-year-old technology still appears to us today, fragmented in the form of our current technology and that VDTs changed newsrooms so much that so many of its functions are handled through computers to this day.</p>
